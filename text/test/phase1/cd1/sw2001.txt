B:  Okay.

A:  Hi.

B:  Hi.

A:  Um, yeah, I would like to talk about how you dress for work, and, and, um,
what do you normally, what type of outfit do you normally have to wear?

B:  Well, I work in, uh, Corporate Control, so we have to dress kind of nice,
so I usually wear skirts and sweaters in the winter time, slacks, I guess.

A:  Uh-huh.

B:  And in the summer, just dresses.  We can't even, well, we're not even
really supposed to wear jeans very often, so,

A:  And is,

B:  It really doesn't vary that much from season to season since the office is
kind of, you know, always the same temperature.

A:  Right, right.  Is there, is there, um, a-, is there a, like a code of dress
where you work?  Do they ask,

B:  Not formally, 

A:  Right.

B:  but it's kind of understood that we're supposed to dress a little bit
nice.  A lot of times we have to go over to, uh, like Jerry Junkins' office
and Bill Ellsworth's office to deliver stuff,

A:  Right.

B:  and we prepare a lot of foils for Marvin, and Bill, so we have to dress a
little bit nice. We're not,

A:  Right, right.  And does it, does it change?  I guess, um, you can, can you
judge like, uh, depending on what you think you'll be doing that day?

B:  Yes, now, you know, if, if every-, like in August when everybody is on
vacation or something, we can dress a little more casual,

A:  Right.

B:  or, ice storms, of course, you know, we all came in in our tennis shoes
but, 

A:  Yes [laughter].

B:  [Laughter] I guess that would have to do with the weather.

A:  Yeah, #yeah, well i-, it's,#

B:  #But, um,#

A:  that's right.  #And it,#

B:  #unless# it's an ex-, you know, an unusual day,

A:  Yeah, and it was usually, uh, also, uh, where I was, it was, um, i-, in
engineering, and,

B:  Uh-huh.

A:  and it was, it was a casual office, there was no formal dress code, but,
um, uh, usually engineers are expected to, to dress, you know, a little more
professionally, it,

B:  Yeah.

A:  just in case things would come up during the day, 

B:  Uh-huh.

A:  sometimes unexpected meetings or a client would come in and would want to
see you,

B:  Right.

A:  uh, other times it could be very casual.  If you knew you would be at a
desk all day and nobody could see you,

B:  Yeah, or, uh-huh.

A:  Um.

B:  What area do you work in?

A:  Uh, well, I was, I was in a, uh, private consulting firm, 

B:  Um.

A:  so, um, and, uh,

B:  Okay.

A:  and, uh, anyway, um, right now I-, I'm not, I'm not there but [laughter],

B:  [Laughter].

A:  but, anyway, um, and seas-, really same, season to season, um, uh, it
changes with the,

B:  it, with the,

A:  weather, you know,

B:  Yeah.

A:  wear light clothing I guess, if it's hot out, but, um,

B:  But then usually in the summer, it's cold in the offices because the air
conditioner,

A:  that's --

B:  is doing it's job so well.

A:  -- that's true, and, and I think also that, um, the women actually have a,
c-, you have a little bit more variety, m-, maybe lighter cotton clothing in
the summer,

B:  Oh, yeah.

A:  and woolens in the winter, where as the, the men often,

B:  It,

A:  have to wear shirt and tie [laughter] no matter,

B:  Uh-huh, just suits.

A:  Right, right. #What time of, what time of the year.#

B:  #There's not a whole lot of fabric variance there.#

A:  That's right.

B:  Uh, they can't have a rayon suit.

A:  Tha-, [laughter] That's, that's true, so, um,

B:  So,

A:  do they, were, were there, um, are you allowed to, um, be casual, like if
it was summer, were, were you allowed to wear sandals, and those, tha-, not
real,

B:  Not really, I think, I mean it's kind of unwritten, but I think we're
supposed to wear hose and, and shoes,

A:  Right.

B:  you know?  Most of the people do, anyway, and most of the women wear, um,
m-, actually most of the women wear suits more than anything else.

A:  Oh, I see, uh-huh.

B:  But, I'm not in that professional of a position, so,

A:  Okay, and, and --

B:  I don't, I'm not expected to do that.

A:  -- and also, like the, um, also the, the, all the supporting kind of stuff,
secretaries, and clerks and things, are they also,

B:  Uh-huh.

A:  they have same, similar?

B:  Yes, pretty much,

A:  Yeah.

B:  I'm a secretary.  Yeah.

A:  Yeah, ours were, ours were different.  I guess it seemed like th-, they
were much, there was much more casual dress, although I don't think everybody
looked at that, you know as a good thing.

B:  Yeah, but there's really no written rule, 

A:  Right.

B:  I guess they couldn't write that down, that might be discrimination, or
something, I don't know [laughter].

A:  That's, [laughter] that's right.

B:  I mean, I've never been told what to wear or what not to wear.  It's just,
you know, judging from what everyone else wears,

A:  Yeah.

B:  is how I determine,

A:  Yeah and,

B:  you know, what I feel a, comfortable in.  

A:  That's right.

B:  You don't want to stand out too much.

A:  Yeah, that's true.  And, um, um.  ((Well, let's see)),

B:  Well, that pretty much covers the topic [laughter].

A:  Yeah. [laughter] I don't know what el-, what more we could say about that,
that,

B:  Well, thanks for calling me.

A:  I was, yeah, nice talking to you, and I guess we just hang up, huh?

B:  Yep.

A:  #Okay, alright.#

B:  #That's all.  Good-bye.#  

A:  Nice talking to you.  Bye-bye.

B:  Okay, bye.
